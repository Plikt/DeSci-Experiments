Lots of cool projects, many more I forgot a bunch, but yeah, Jocelyn is always curating this cool landscape, so just check it out. I have the Twitter right there. And yeah, so we just heard about it. So sharing scientific data is super important. Why? Because, well, if we share data, we can collaborate much more easily. We can build bigger data sets and bigger data sets means more statistical power, reliable results, right? So that's pretty cool. And it also means more access to the data that, so there's not the same access to cool instruments that help you with data collection across labs. So if you're in an underfunded research institution, you just may not have the ability to collect the same type of data that a well-funded institution may have. So if we all share data, we all have better access to make cool scientific discoveries. So that's pretty cool, right? But also sharing scientific data right now. It's pretty expensive, it's pretty vulnerable because it's stored on centralized databases where we just have to trust that they keep the database running. It's also not rewarded. So currently, what counts in science is having your PDF cited, but it doesn't matter if you make your data accessible, like you just cannot accrue credit to it. Or there's some ways you can, but it's just not really easy. And it's also pretty painful. So there's a couple of repos out there where you can store your data. These are funded by some governmental institutions. There you access not great. And then also, if you want to find the data, you need to know which repo it's stored at. So you need to find the repo. Then you need to find the data. It's all, it's a hassle, so it's not great.\\nSummary:Sharing scientific data is important as it allows for better collaboration, bigger data sets, reliable results, and better access for researchers in underfunded institutions. However, currently sharing data is expensive, vulnerable, and not rewarded. It is stored on centralized databases which requires that we trust those servers to keep running. Also, there are no incentives for for making the data accessible. Currently, the only way that we can give credit for using someone else's work is citing their PDF. But with PDF citations, it doesn't matter if you make your data accessible. Sharing data right now isn't worth the cost and time for the researcher.\\nParagraph:\"\n",

Okay, so what is this idea going fair and doing fair? So this presentation will be in two parts and the first part going fair is really about kind of the history of where this idea came from about fair and kind of how it's matured up until today and then in the next section on doing fair, just to kind of give you a snapshot of some state of the art developments right now on the implementation of the fair principles and kind of, you know, the doors that opens up to kind of a new way of looking at computing and a new way of doing information exchange and being able to access larger amounts of data for kind of, you know, distributed learning type analyses.\\nSummary:What is going and doing fair? We’ll break this down into two parts - first we’ll explore the history of fair and how it has matured until today, then we’ll explore the implementation of the Fair principles as a novel method of computing, information exchange, and distributed learning analysis.\\nParagraph:Okay, so I'm going to start here with a picture from, that I took in 2019 in the gentleman at the podium, his name is George Straun and in 1995, he was the director of something called the NSF Net, the National Science Foundation Network and would George is saying at this, in this presentation here is that in 2019, the internet was now 50 years old. So in particular, what he's really referring to is that this key technology of the modern internet, TCP IP was invented in 1969 and underwent a lot of research and development for 20 years. Then there was another 10 years where TCP IP was used to implement the NSF Net and the goal of the project was to connect, I think, 100 American universities to the national supercomputing centers that had grown up in the United States. And it's kind of strange to think about it now, but just the idea that there were local computing networks and if you wanted to interconnect them, that that was a real engineering problem. It was interoperability of the networks. And so this TCP IP was helping to create what they call the internet, the interoperable network. But it was, you know, at that time, a real engineering problem, right?\\nSummary:In 1995, George Straun was the director of the National Science Foundation Network (NSF Net). And the goal of the NSF at that time was to connect 100 American Universities to the national supercomputing centers. Now, while this seems simple now the key technology of the internet, TCP IP, was invented just 26 years earlier in 1969, and finding a way to connect many local networks running on this invention was a huge engineering challenge. They were asking the question, how do we make a global internet? An interoperable network.\\nParagraph:\"\n",
